## <im> For ternary operation conditioning the jsx is closed within parenthesis.

### Below is the example comparison between Nesred ternary operation and && operation. && Operation is easier.

```js
{
  friend.balance < 0 ? (
    <p className="red">
      you Owe {friend.name} {Math.abs(friend.balance)}{" "}
    </p>
  ) : friend.balance > 0 ? (
    <p className="green">
      {" "}
      {friend.name} Owes you {friend.balance}
    </p>
  ) : (
    <p>You and {friend.name} are even</p>
  );
}

//   Now && comparion
{
  friend.balance < 0 && (
    <p className="red">
      You owe {friend.name} {Math.abs(friend.balance)}
    </p>
  );
}
{
  friend.balance > 0 && (
    <p className="green">
      {friend.name} owes you {friend.balance}
    </p>
  );
}
{
  friend.balance === 0 && <p>You and {friend.name} are even.</p>;
}
```

## <as> Our custom Button Component will not have access to eventlistner onClick. So we pass onclick prop to the html button.

Certainly, here are short notes on your provided code:

- You have a custom `Button` component that takes two props: `children` and `onClick`.
- The `Button` component is used to create a button element in your application.
- It doesn't handle the click event itself but instead passes the `onClick` prop to the underlying HTML button element.
- By passing the `onClick` prop, you allow the parent component to define what happens when the button is clicked.
- In your specific example, when the button is clicked, it toggles the `showAddFriend` state in the parent component, either showing or hiding something based on the current value of `show`.
- This approach allows for flexible and reusable buttons that can perform different actions depending on how they are used in various parts of your application.

```js
<Button onClick={() => setShowAddFriend((show) => !show)}>

// onclick is not avaialble to Custom Button or custom tags so we pass that onClick prop to child component.
function Button({ children, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button className="button" onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## <qs> There was a huge bug when i did not include optional chaining after selectedfried?.id. So beware

<im> The optional we do because the cur or selected friend will be set to null initially and also at times when its already selected so to prevent the error.

```js
const isSelected = selectedFriend?.id === friend.id;
```

```js
// ^There is close relation between close button and select button if there are multiple members in list we should check with id.Here also i did recieve bug so optional chaining before id.
    setSelectedFriend((selected) =>
      selected?.id === newFriend.id ? null : newFriend

```
